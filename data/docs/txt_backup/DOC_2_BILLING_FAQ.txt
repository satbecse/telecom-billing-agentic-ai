=============================================================================
SECTION 1: BILLING CYCLE AND INVOICES
=============================================================================

Q: When is my billing cycle?
A: Your billing cycle is a 30-day period that begins on your plan activation date. 
   For example, if you activated on the 15th, your cycle runs from the 15th of 
   each month to the 14th of the following month.

Q: When are invoices generated?
A: Invoices are generated on the last day of your billing cycle and delivered 
   within 24-48 hours via email or postal mail, depending on your preference.

Q: What is the payment due date?
A: Payment is due 15 days after the invoice date. For example, if your invoice 
   is dated January 15, payment is due by January 30.

=============================================================================
SECTION 2: PRORATION RULES
=============================================================================

Q: What is proration?
A: Proration is when we calculate charges based on the portion of the billing 
   cycle you actually used a service, rather than the full monthly price.

Q: When does proration occur?
A: Proration applies when you:
   - Start a new plan mid-cycle (partial first month)
   - Add a new service or add-on mid-cycle
   - Upgrade or downgrade your plan mid-cycle
   - Cancel service before the end of your cycle (no refund for partial months)

Q: How is prorated amount calculated?
A: Formula: (Monthly Price / 30) × Number of days service was active
   Example: Adding Device Protection ($12.99/month) on day 20 of a 30-day cycle
   Prorated charge = ($12.99 / 30) × 10 = $4.33
